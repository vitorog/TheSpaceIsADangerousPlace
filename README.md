# The Space is a Dangerous Place
An Asteroids-inspired game created in ActionScript 3 for a school project.

# Description

This game was created for a university course assignment and it was made in Flash and ActionScript 3. The player has to survive as long as he can by shooting asteroids and enemy ships while managing the energy resource. The assignment was for a 2-person team. I created the game and my teammate created the [website](http://vitor-eid-2012-1.deviantart.com/art/The-Space-is-a-Dangerous-Place-Website-328241505) with information about the game (which was also part of the assignment).
